- This portfolio is about creating an interactive Data Science Salary & Job Trends Dashboard using Excel. It analyzes job distribution, salary trends by role and company size, and sector-wise employment patterns through pivot tables, charts, slicers, and an optional map for visualization.
## Step by Step Process

1. Use the given data  
   - Open the Worksheet on Uncleaned DS Jobs and the Transform Tables:  
     - Sal By Role  
     - Sal By State  
     - Sal By Size  

2. Design the dashboard to highlight the following:  
   - State with the most Data Science jobs  
   - Job role with the highest average salary  
   - Company size that pays the highest salary  
   - Sector with the lowest & highest number of Data Science jobs  
   - Sector with the minimum & maximum average salary  

3. Create a pivot table  
   - Use pivot tables to summarize data for sector jobs and salary (d & e)  

4. Generate charts for reports  
   - Use bar, column, or pie charts to visualize salary trends and job distribution  

5. Insert slicers for filtering  
   - Add slicers for role type, company size, and state to make the dashboard interactive  

6. Add a map (optional)  
   - If available in your Excel version, insert a map visualization to show job distribution by state  

7. Apply design & formatting  
   - Customize the colors, fonts, and layout to make the dashboard visually appealing  

8. Complete the dashboard  
   - Ensure all required visuals and reports are included  
   - The slicers should be functional and interactive
